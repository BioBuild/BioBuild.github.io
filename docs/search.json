    "text": "Hi there, I’m Simon. Thanks for coming along :)\nabout me: I am a molecular biologist and a data scientist based in Munich, Germany. I am driven by discovery first and excitement second which means that I still enjoy solving puzzles but what ultimately motivates me is the direction of the work.\nIn my PhD research I am studying the the effects of mitochondrial DNA mutations across healthy human tissues in ageing and in psychiatric disease. More generally put, my scientific interests lie in how gene regulatory effects are mediated over time and how we can find the cellular states and molecular correlates underlying biological phenotypes. To learn more about this, I am using a combination of large–scale statistical genetics and single–cell & spatial multi–omics approaches with the objective to inform experimental validation. In these endeavours I am greatly supported by my PhD advisor and mentor Dr. Na Cai at Helmholtz Pioneer Campus, my co–advisor Dr. Matthias Heinig at the Institute of Computational Biology, and more recently by our close collaborator Dr. Paolo Casale also based at Helmholtz Pioneer Campus. I am a member of the graduate program provided by the Munich School for Data Science (MUDS) and was awarded the Add-on Fellowships for Interdisciplinary Life Science granted by the Joachim Herz foundation.\nBefore starting my current position, I studied Molecular Biotechnology in Munich and Heidelberg where I did my master thesis on deep learning approaches for single–cell data integration with Prof. Oliver Stegle at the German Cancer Research Center and pursued multiple experimental and computational research internships in four different countries both in academia and the private sector. I also hold an additional professional degree as a laboratory assistant in the field of chemistry.\nOutside of work, I like to spend time running & hiking the outdoors and singing in choirs. I also think about the societal implications of science and technology a lot and how the political discourse can be based on empirical findings. Along those lines, I co–founded and coordinated the local branch of the climate activist group scientists for future in Heidelberg while I was still based there."

    "text": "I’m really excited that the conference committee at Biology of Genomes has selected our abstract for an oral presentaion (I binge watched their keynotes on youtube during my masters so this is kind of a big deal for me).\nI will present our work on mitochondrial heteroplasmy, which is just mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations. But since mtDNA is not diploid but occurs in multiple hundreds to thousands of copies per mitochondrion, DNA mutations often affect only a percentage of the mtDNA molecules and this is called heteroplasmy. Here’s a graphical illustration of it:\n\nIn my presentation at BOG 2024 I will talk about:\n\nthe need for a quantitative description of mtDNA heteroplasmy and its effects in humans\nwhy we need tissue specific information, which brings the challenge of quantifying heteroplasmy from RNAseq alignment data as a proxy for the genotype.\nour robust computational pipeline to extract high quality mtDNA heteroplasmies from RNAseq data.\nthe ability to quantify not only mtDNA mutations but also a specific type of mtRNA modifications form reproducible mismatch signatures from RNAseq.\nour thorough evaluation procedure using simulated data select appropriate statistical models to test for phenotype reltionships in such data.\nhow this pipeline yields a comprehensive description of the tissue specific effects of such apparent mtDNA heteroplasmies on donor age and mitochondrial gene expression.\n\nI hope our work will be useful for anyone interested in learning phenotypic relationships from RNAseq derived mtDNA heteroplasmy data or - more general - anyone interested in learning phehotype relationships from RNAseq cohorts.\nIf that sounds interesting to you please reach out and let’s meet. Of course, I’m also always curious to learn about the research you’re doing and to discuss future opportunities. So if you are attending BoG2024 please get in touch!"
